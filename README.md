# One-Mass Oscillator Optimization

In this project, various optimization algorithms will be applied to fit a one-mass oscillator model to real-world data. The objective is to minimize the sum of the squared residuals between the model predictions and the observed amplitudes of a one-mass oscillator system across different frequencies.

## Project Goal

The goal of the project is to determine the optimal values for the decision parameters that result in the best fit of the one-mass oscillator model to the observed amplitudes.

## Optimization Algorithms

The following optimization algorithms from scipy python library used for comparison:

- Nelder Mead
- Powell
- CG (Conjugate Gradient)
- Newton-CG
- BFGS
- Simulated Annealing
- Differential Evolution

## Results and Conclusions

A comparison table is provided in the end of the jupyter notebook to evaluate the performance of each optimization algorithm. Based on the results, conclusions will be drawn regarding the effectiveness of the algorithms in fitting the one-mass oscillator model to the observed amplitudes.
